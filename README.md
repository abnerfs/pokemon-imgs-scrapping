# Pokemon Images
A simple scrap script for pokemondb.net that downloads an image for every pokemon in pokedex. I hope this help someone, if you just need the images I've also uploaded a zip in the release section.

# Usage
- Download or clone de project
- Install the dependencies (**npm install** or just **yarn**)
- Run **node app.js** then the script will start to download images to **/images** folder
